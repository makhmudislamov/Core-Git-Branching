## Plot

John woke up from the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally John would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was a construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of John’s specialities and today would prove to be no different as he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sound of animals in the distance.
John had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally John would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense green, brown and chartreuse, he called out a zookeeper but got no response.
The smell of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

John met the Unicorn King there. The King was impressed by John's brave heart and curiosity. The Unicorn King said magic words that John didn understand but he felt strong feeling inside of him. He was granted magic powers - endless bravery and strong curious mind.
The end.
